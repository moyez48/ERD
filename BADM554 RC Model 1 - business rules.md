1\) Given that brief and incomplete description of operations for RC\_ Models Company, write entities, attributes and all applicable business rules to establish relationships. Write the Entities/attributes in the format below.

Entity (Attribute1, Attribute2, …)

**Customer** (Customer\_ID, Customer\_Name, Email, …)

**Product** (Product\_ID, Manufacturer\_ID, Product\_Type, Unit\_Price, Min\_Order\_Quantity,...)

**Invoice** ( Invoice\_ID, Order\_ID,Customer\_ID, Invoice\_Date, …)

**Invoice\_Line** ( Invoice\_Line\_ID, Invoice\_ID, Product\_ID, Quantity, Unit\_Price, ...)

**Manufacturer** (Manufacturer\_ID, Manufacturer\_Name, Contact\_info,...)

**Purchase** (Purchase\_ID, Purchase\_date, Payment\_method, …)

**Purchase\_Line**(Purchase\_Line\_ID, Purchase\_ID, Product\_ID, Unit\_Cost, Qty\_Ordered,...)

*Inventory?*

2\) Write Business Rules for the relationships : Use the following three business rules as examples, writing the business rules for relationships in the same format. Requirements/rules that don’t specific entities, attributes, relationships, constraints  should be written separately.

**Relationships (one to one, one to many, many to many)**

**1:M**

Manufacturer (one) \-\> Purchase (many)

Purchase (one) \-\> Purchase\_line (many)

Purchase\_Line (one) \-\> Product (many)\*\*\* 

Customer (one) \-\> Invoices\_Line (Many)

Invoice (one) \-\> Invoice\_Line (many)

Product (one) \-\> Invoice\_Line (many)

Product (one) \-\> Purchase\_Line (many)\*\*\*

**Constraints**

**Customer \- Invoice**

- A customer may generate one or many invoices  
- Each invoice is generated by only one customer  
- Some customers may not (yet) generated an invoice

   **Invoice \- Line**

- One invoice may contain one or many lines  
- Each line belongs to exactly one invoice

**Line \- Product**

- Each line refers to exactly one product  
- One product may appear on one or many lines  
  **Product/Inventory \- Manufacturer**  
- Each product is supplied by exactly one manufacturer  
- One manufacturer may supply one, or more than one products  
- This tracks products available  
  **Procurement \- Manufacturer**  
- Each purchase is made from exactly one manufacturer  
- One manufacturer may correspond to zero or many purchases  
  - 

3\) Document any assumptions you need to make in a section called assumptions 

 Invoice is only for products that been shipped to customers.

We assume Invoice\_Line tracks orders that have been made but not necessarily shipped

4\) Create a draft ER model in [https://www.drawio.com/](https://www.drawio.com/)  . Dont worry about filling in all attributes. Just entities and relationships. This is a draft, you will work on it
